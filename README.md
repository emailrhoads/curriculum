# Curriculum
The goal of this document is to create a guided path of discovery. This approach to self-eduction relies on two key assumptions:

1. **Intelligence is not singular.** There are many intelligences, each with their own value.
2. **Immersive activies are the best learning environment.** You learn better when chasing a curiosity than to avoid failure. Paper tests are not the desired approach to learning, but a last resort. Immersive problems are what (an interesting) life is literally comprised of and solutions to them could be described as "wisdom". The goal of this method is to grant you experience and wisdom; not rote understanding.
